				<span>Professor Dean Snyder, head of the Sculpture department, is exhibiting Nymph_O, an intriguing translucent inflatable.</span>
				<p>Most visitors are shocked to see the electrifying performance art now on view at RISD’s Sol Koffler Graduate Student Gallery. Hooked up to bundles of neuromuscular electrodes activated by toy car remote controls, a man and a woman engage in casual conversation. But when a child presses down on the transmitter’s button, the man suddenly stops mid-sentence as his jaw clamps down and his mouth mechanically snaps shut. The involuntary movement incites soft gasps from wide-eyed viewers.</p>

				<p>The human-powered installation is just one of the stimulating artworks on view through July 19 in Carrefour: Intersections of Biomedical Research and Art, which features the work of 11 artists immersed in the biomedical field. Planned in conjunction with the 150th anniversary celebration of Rhode Island Hospital, the exhibition is hosted by the RISD Research Initiative (RRI) and Lifespan, the hospital’s parent organization and a major affiliate of Brown’s Alpert Medical School, and ties in with RISD’s STEM to STEAM initiative. <a href="">&gt;&gt; read more</a> </p>
