					<p>The STEAM movement adds another powerful voice as Sesame Street begins to sing its praises: the iconic educational program has announced that its 43rd season will focus on integrating the Arts into its existing STEM focus, most specifically in a new 11-minute episodic segment called “Elmo the Musical.”</p>

					<p>“Elmo the Musical” is an interactive, fun-filled adventure created by Elmo and the child at home. With lots of singing and dancing, Elmo uses his imagination and math skills, such as enumeration, relational concepts, addition/subtraction, and geometric shapes to solve problems. The STEAM-based learning will continue after each segment ends—Sesame Street is supplying children and their caregivers with exciting games and learning tools accessible on www.sesamestreet.org and mobile devices. <a href="">&gt;&gt; read more</a> </p>

					<p>Named the 2012 Georgia Charter School of the Year, Drew Charter School in Atlanta is a K-8 school with a curriculum focus on STEAM and a strong foundation of literacy. Drew Charter School utilizes a team teaching approach that allows teachers to know all students as individuals and to collaborate across disciplines.</p>

					<p>Drew’s STEAM focus has yielded continued improvement in test scores and student success: Drew students exceed the Georgia and Atlanta public school averages in Reading, Language Arts, Math, Social Studies and Science. The school’s educational approach is framed around four guiding principles:</p>

					<h3>South by Southwest Conference 2013</h3>
					<img src="#" class="three-column-three">
					

				<p>RISD President John Maeda will return to Austin, Texas this March to participate in the city’s South by Southwest Conference.  The president will moderate the panel “STEM to STEAM: Full Circle from Education to Economy,” a discussion intended to illuminate the ways in which Art + Design serve to deepen the value of technological advances and enhance the processes of scientific learning.</p>

				<p>Thanks to panelists like Rosemarie Truglio, Vice President of Education and Research at Sesame Workshop, the STEAM movement is making good noise: Elmo has announced that Season 43 of Sesame Street will incorporate Art + Design in its learning segments— a concrete example of the program’s long, demonstrated history of using creative innovation to educate children in Science and Math.</p>

				<p>The South by Southwest panel will stress the importance of integration: the STEM to STEAM acronym is a visual reminder of the initiative’s intent to use Art + Design as a relevant tool in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math disciplines.</p>

				<p>President Maeda will be joined by a group of panelists who bring distinctive and valuable voices to STEAM:</p>

					<em>Vice-President, Adobe Education</em></p>

				<p><strong>Matt Goldman</strong><br>

					<h3>Congressional STEAM Caucus</h3>
					<img src="#" class="three-column-three">
					

					<p>On February 14, 2013 RISD President and STEAM champion <strong>John Maeda</strong> co-hosted the kickoff briefing of the bipartisan Congressional STEAM Caucus, co-chaired by Congresswoman <strong>Suzanne Bonamici</strong> (D-OR) and Congressman <strong>Aaron Schock</strong> (R-IL).</p>

					<p>The event included brief testimonials from experts in the fields of science, design, art and education. Speakers emphasized the ways in which STEAM contributes to innovation, and plenty of people were listening – a standing-room-only crowd even though the original briefing room had been moved to a larger space.</p>

					<p>“Innovation depends on the problem solving, risk taking and creativity that are natural to the way artists and designers think,” Maeda noted. “Art and science – once inextricably linked – are better together than apart.”</p>

					<p>It’s that eye toward innovation that has Washington talking. As of February 14, representatives from 11 states had signed on to the Caucus; in addition to Bonamici and Schock, the include: <strong>Matt Cartwright</strong> (D-PA); <strong>David Cicilline</strong> (D-RI); <strong>Gerald Connolly</strong> (D-VA); Jim Langevin (D-RI); <strong>Dave Loebsack</strong> (D-IA); <strong>Eleanor Holmes Norton</strong> (D-DC); <strong>Jared Polis</strong> (D-CO); <strong>Tim Ryan</strong> (D-OH); <strong>Bobby Scott</strong> (D-VA); <strong>Carol Shea-Porter</strong> (D-NH); and <strong>Louise Slaughter</strong> (D-NY).</p>

					<p>“We frequently discuss the importance of STEM education, but we can’t ignore the importance of engaging and educating both halves of the brain,” Bonamici maintains. “Creative, critical thinking leads to innovation. The integration of the arts into STEM curriculum will excite creativity in the minds of our future leaders.”</p>

					<p><em>Panelists at the briefing included:</em></p>

					<p><strong>Trevor Bailey</strong><br>
					<em>Director, Adobe Education Worldwide </em></p>

					<p><strong>Bill O’Brien</strong><br>
					<em>Senior Advisor for Program Innovation
										National Endowment for the Arts</em></p>

					<p><strong>Eric Siegel</strong><br>
					<em>Director, New York Hall of Science</em></p>

					<p><strong>Joyce Ward</strong><br>
					<em>Education Coordinator
										US Patent and Trademark Office</em></p>
