					<p>The STEAM movement adds another powerful voice as Sesame Street begins to sing its praises: the iconic educational program has announced that its 43rd season will focus on integrating the Arts into its existing STEM focus, most specifically in a new 11-minute episodic segment called “Elmo the Musical.”</p>

					<p>“Elmo the Musical” is an interactive, fun-filled adventure created by Elmo and the child at home. With lots of singing and dancing, Elmo uses his imagination and math skills, such as enumeration, relational concepts, addition/subtraction, and geometric shapes to solve problems. The STEAM-based learning will continue after each segment ends—Sesame Street is supplying children and their caregivers with exciting games and learning tools accessible on www.sesamestreet.org and mobile devices. <a href="">&gt;&gt; read more</a> </p>

					<p>Named the 2012 Georgia Charter School of the Year, Drew Charter School in Atlanta is a K-8 school with a curriculum focus on STEAM and a strong foundation of literacy. Drew Charter School utilizes a team teaching approach that allows teachers to know all students as individuals and to collaborate across disciplines.</p>

					<p>Drew’s STEAM focus has yielded continued improvement in test scores and student success: Drew students exceed the Georgia and Atlanta public school averages in Reading, Language Arts, Math, Social Studies and Science. The school’s educational approach is framed around four guiding principles:</p>
